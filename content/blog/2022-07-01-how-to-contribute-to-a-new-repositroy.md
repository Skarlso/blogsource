# How to contribute to a new repository

Hello Dear readers.

Today, I'm going to walk you through a process of contributing into a new repository. If you are new to Go development
and would like to contribute somewhere but are at a loss in large repositories, this post will be for you.

I selected the top repository in trending Go today. Which is [istio](https://github.com/istio/istio). I think that's
sufficiently large and I have no idea about the repository, so I'm going to walk you through my process. I did choose
something that is in the area of my expertise though so I have an easier time deciphering what it is trying to do in the
first place.

That is a good place to start at. Look for something that you have at least a tiny bit of a clue about. Or if the area
is completely dark for you, read up on it first. In case of istio, that would probably be Envoy and Kubernetes and a bit
of networking.

## Notes

As mentioned in [this](https://skarlso.github.io/2022/06/26/hacking-on-capa/) post, I take notes about a repository in my notebook when I first encounter it. Well, how does
this look like exactly?
