# Reader's Digest

I thought it would a cool idea if I kept a summary of the things I've read or listened to on a monthly
basis. Here is March of 2021 so far. Enjoy.

## The Aurora Database paper

This one is an interesting read.

## Rhythm of War - Brandon Sanderson

An epic continuation of this saga with over a 1000 pages long and 54 hours of listening time on Audible.

## How to take smart notes

This one's review will be condensed because it would be rather lengthy otherwise.

That's all for this month.
Thanks for reading,
Gergely.
