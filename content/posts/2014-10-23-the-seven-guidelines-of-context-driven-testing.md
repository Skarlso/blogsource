Hi Folks!

I just wanted to share with you my mind map on the seven principles of Context Driven Testing.

I used the notion of dragons since it&#8217;s seven. And a dragon is usually seven headed in my mind&#8230;

So without further ado&#8230;

I have a hand drawn as well but I&#8217;m guessing that one wouldn&#8217;t be of much use since it follows my own imagination.

Here are the seven principles in points which correspond to the leafs.

  1. Value -> Practice -> Depends -> Context => The value of any practice depends on its context.
  2. People -> Working -> Together -> Important => People, working together, are the most important part of any project’s context. ( The mob, trying to kill the dragon by working together. )
  3. Problem -> Project -> Solution => The product is a solution. If the problem isn’t solved, the product doesn’t work. ( The sword. It&#8217;s a sword but if it doesn&#8217;t kill the Dragon it&#8217;s useless. )
  4. Good Testing -> Intellectual Challenge => Good software testing is a challenging intellectual process. ( Well it&#8217;s a dragon with glasses. That&#8217;s something you rarely see. )
  5. Good Practice | Bad Practice -> In Context -> No Best Practices => There are good practices in context, but there are no best practices. ( This one was a little bit tricky. But basically you want to solve the dungeon and not plow through it )
  6. Uncertainty => <span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.8em;">Projects unfold over time in ways that are often not predictable. ( For me this one word was enough. )</span>
  7. Exercised By All In Time -> Judgement | Skill | Cooperatively => Only through judgment and skill, exercised cooperatively throughout the entire project, are we able to do the right things at the right times to effectively test our products. ( It&#8217;s a flexing dragon&#8230; Easy, right? )

So this map helped me to remember everything. The descriptions, applications that are further described I remembered by using this mind map as a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_of_loci" target="_blank">loci</a>.

I hope somebody found this useful.

Thanks for reading!
