There is a small tip I'd like to share about this. People write that in order to get better, you'd have to write code.

This is a partial truth imho. I was recently talking with a friend of mine about these things and realized that I've done this
before but I've neglected this practice and I was missing it now. Even though it's the single most important thing you could do to
TRULY be better at something. Not just programming.

The Word I'm looking for for you, dear reader, to remember and never forget is: **REFLECTION**. Reflecting means, you go back and
look the crap you did. Reflecting means that you look back on the code you wrote. On the architecture you created on the work
you've done. Not just do it and then never look back, that's stupid. You have to analyse it. Dissect it. Look at your notes, your
work your results. Is it still in one piece? Is it a viable software given that time? How would you do it better today?

This is a very important practice. It's very boring and it's tedious and time consuming. Time you'd better off writing new code,
right? WRONG! You have to know your errors and learn from them. I know you already know this sentence, but it's crucial to
understand that in order to remember your errors, you have to take a good hard look at them from time to time. And that is true
for things that you did the right way back then. You usually remember those better, because you keep doing them.

But since you are trying not to do your errors, you slowly forget them and are bound to repeat it.

And that's another proverb. "Those who don't know history are doomed to repeat it.".

Do you still remember your notes about that particular hard worked project you had 4-5 years ago? Did you take them?

Thus, my advice is... to just take a moment and look back. Re-read your notes. Re-read your code. Re-evaluate your project. From
time to time.

Thanks for reading,
Gergely.
