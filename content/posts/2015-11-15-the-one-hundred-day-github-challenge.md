Hello folks. 

Today, I present to you the One Hundred Day Github Challenge. 

The rules are simple:

  1. Minimum of **One** commit every day for a **Hundred days**.
  2. Commit has to be **meaningful** but can be as little as a fix in a Readme.md.
  3. Doesn&#8217;t matter if you are on vacation, there are no exceptions.
  4. **There. Are. No. Exceptions.**
  5. If you **fail** a day, you have to **start over**.
  6. **No cheating.** You only cheat yourself, so this is really up to you.

Let me be more clear here, because it seems I wasn&#8217;t clear enough. What you make out of this challenge, it&#8217;s up to you. If you just update a readme.md for hundred days, that&#8217;s fine. Just do it every day. It&#8217;s a commitment. At least you&#8217;ll have a nice Readme.

Also, let me be clear on another thing. THERE ARE NO EXCEPTIONS. Even on holidays. No. Exceptions.

So there you have it. It&#8217;s easy, but then again, it&#8217;s not.

Mine starts today! 100&#8230;

Thanks for reading.
  
And happy coding.
  
Gergely.
