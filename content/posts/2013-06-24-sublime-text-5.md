Hello everybody. I&#8217;ve been messing around with sublime for some time now. And been using it to write entires and stuff. So here I was thinking why the hell I should not us it as my main blog entry writer. And being the curious guy I was I thought that creating a plugin that let&#8217;s you submit your post from your favorite editor is just the thing I need. 

So without any further ado here it is&#8230; The wordpress blog entry submitter plugin for sublime text: <a href='https://github.com/Skarlso/SublimeWordpressPlugin' target='blank'>Sublime WordPress Plugin</a>

Please enjoy.
