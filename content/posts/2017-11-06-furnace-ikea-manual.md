Hi there folks.

Just a quick post, of how I went on and created an IKEA manual about [Furnace](https://github.com/Skarlso/go-furnace).

Page 1: ![Page 1](/img/ikea-furnace-1.png).
Page 2: ![Page 2](/img/ikea-furnace-2.png).

I drew these using [Krita](https://krita.org/en/). I mostly used a mouse but I also used a Wacom Bamboo drawing tabled, for sketches and such.

Thanks,
Gergely.
