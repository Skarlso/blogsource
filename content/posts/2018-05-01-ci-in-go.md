# Intro

Hello folks.

Today, I'm going to write a pseudo CI in Go for fun and learning. I'm going to try and write a basic CI which consists of the following capabilities.

* Can connect to multiple servers via a small agent on the server
* Can run a simple job (like executing a bash script) configured in yaml / json / whatever
* Can output the log of that job
* Have a list of slave servers and some data about them

I think that's going to be enough for a post. Let's get started.

# Connection of Slaves

I'm going to use Redis to store the conncetions to slaves.
