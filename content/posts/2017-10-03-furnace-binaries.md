Hey folks.

Quick note. Furnace now comes pre-compiled easy to access binaries which you can download and use out of the box.

No need to install anything, or compile the source. Just download, unzip and use.

Here is the website: [Furnace Website](https://skarlso.github.io/furnace-web).

Enjoy,
Cheers,
Gergely.
